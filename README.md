## Abstract

We attempted to address the problem of classifying planned/unplanned localities. Localities categorization could assist municipality in proper allocation of resources.However,  a variety of factors have to be incorporated for any such classification, which makes this a complex task.To tackle all such intricacies, we propose a deep learning approach for classifying different areas using satellite imagery. We propose a multi-task learning framework that learns variety of features from the satellite images and findsthe one most effective for classifying planned or unplanned developments. For training and evaluation of our proposed method we have compiled a dataset containing labelled satellite images  of three geographically diverse cities of Pakistan. Our experimental results validate the proposed technique
